## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CaptainTotte/Quiz.git
   cd Quiz
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

4. **Access the Game**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
   - The admin panel can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`.

### Docker Setup

You can run the application using Docker for a containerized deployment.

#### Using Dockerfile

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t quiz .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 quiz
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Using Docker Compose

1. **Start the Application with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` is used to build the Docker image for the application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python-based image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the project files
COPY . .

# Expose the port FastAPI runs on (default is 8000)
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the FastAPI application when the container starts
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yaml` file simplifies running the application with Docker:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"  # Map port 8000 on the host to port 8000 in the container
    volumes:
      - .:/app       # Mount the project directory for live updates during development
    environment:
      - APP_ENV=development  # Environment variables (can be customized)
```
